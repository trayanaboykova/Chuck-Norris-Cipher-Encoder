# 💬 Chuck Norris Cipher Encoder

A console-based Chuck Norris Cipher Encoder/Decoder built in Java.
Developed as part of my Hyperskill learning path, this project explores binary encoding, string manipulation, and user input validation while implementing a quirky unary encoding system named after Chuck Norris.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The project progresses through multiple stages, each adding new functionality:

- **Character Analysis** – Breaks input strings into individual characters.
- **Binary Conversion** – Converts ASCII characters into 7-bit binary representation.
- **Unary Encoding** – Implements the Chuck Norris Cipher, transforming binary strings into sequences of 0s and spaces.
- **Decoding** – Reverses the process to reconstruct the original message.
- **User Interface** – Provides a simple encode/decode/exit loop with input validation.

## 🎯 What I Learned

- 🔢 **Binary Fundamentals**: Worked with 7-bit ASCII and binary string conversions.
- 🧩 **Algorithmic Thinking**: Designed an algorithm to implement the unary Chuck Norris encoding.
- 🔄 **Loops & Conditionals**: Built a game-like loop to continuously process user input.
- 🧑‍💻 **Error Handling**: Added validation for incorrect encoded messages.
- 📐 **Modular Design**: Split logic into encoding, decoding, and validation methods for clarity.

## 🔧 Features
- ✅ Encode plain text into Chuck Norris unary code.
- ✅ Decode Chuck Norris unary code back into readable text.
- ✅ Input validation – detects and rejects invalid encodings.
- ✅ Interactive CLI with a simple encode/decode/exit loop.
- ✅ Support for spaces, letters, numbers, and punctuation.

## 🤔 How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Chuck-Norris-Cipher-Encoder.git
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Compile and run Main.java.
4. Follow the prompts to set code length and symbol range, then start guessing!

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, I:

Strengthened my knowledge of binary systems and character encoding.

Improved my string parsing and manipulation skills in Java.

Learned how to design robust input validation for console applications.

Gained experience in combining algorithm design with user-friendly CLI programming.
